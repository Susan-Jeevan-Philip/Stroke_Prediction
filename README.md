# Stroke_Prediction
Stroke remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally, emphasizing the critical need for proactive measures to identify and mitigate potential risk factors. We put together a set of ten important factors that we thing can affect the chances of having stroke. These factors include things like gender, age, high blood pressure, heart disease, marital status, the type of work you do, where you live, average glucose level (related to blood sugar), Body Mass Index (BMI), and whether or not you smoke. We're using this information to create a tool that can help predict the likelihood of someone having a stroke based on these factors. 

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the chances for stroke based these features. The model will be trained on a dataset consisting of these features. The dataset will be pre-processed to remove any missing values and to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for training the model. 

The machine learning model will be developed using Python and the scikit-learn library. Several machine learning algorithms will be evaluated, including Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Cross-validation techniques will be utilized to minimize overfitting and ensure the robustness of the models. 

The performance of the machine learning model will be evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision and recall. The model will be tested on a separate dataset to evaluate its ability to generalize to new, unseen data. 

The potential benefits of this project are enormous and the goal is to make it easier for both individuals and healthcare professionals to take preventive actions and improve overall health.
